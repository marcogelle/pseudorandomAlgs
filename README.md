# pseudorandomAlgs
Just a fun mini project on implementing pseudorandom number generators.
Made with Python 3.8

Run main.py to play around with the generator.

Run visualize.py to see a how this implementation, which uses a linear congruential generator, compares with Python's built-in random module.
Matplotlib is required to run the visualization.
