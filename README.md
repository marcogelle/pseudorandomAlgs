# pseudorandomAlgs
Just a fun mini project on implementing pseudorandom number generators.
Made with Python 3.8.

Run main.py to play around with the generator.

Run visualize.py and visualizereals.py to see a how this implementation of a linear congruential generator compares with Python's built-in random module.
NumPy and Matplotlib are required to run the visualizations.

So far, I have only implemented the linear congruential generator. I might add more algorithms in the future.
